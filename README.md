# Neural Behavioral Modeling

Through mathematical modeling and computer simulations, I implemented several neural and behavioral models. Homework assignments of NTUPsy 7277 are presented.

## Main Implementations

* neuronal models
* neural network models
* cognitive models
* agent-based models
* system dynamics

## Others
